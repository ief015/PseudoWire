Pseudo Wire is a scriptable logic simulator designed as a
recreation of Wiremod (an addon for Garry's Mod) in a
standalone environment.

Create logical machines using Lua. Spawn parts and
components, wire them together, and interact with them.

Pseudo Wire is designed so that anyone who has used Wiremod
before would be able to pick up how to play in almost no
time at all. Any newcomers shouldn't take too long get the
hang of how the game plays, feels and works.
