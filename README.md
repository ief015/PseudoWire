NOTICE - READ FIRST
===================

This is the source code for an old project of mine called *Pseudo Wire*, which was created while I was learning how to program in C++ a few years back.
Here, by request, I've uploaded the source as it was where I last left off. **The code you see here may be poorly formatted, poorly designed, riddled with bugs, or outright uncompilable**.

This project source is for educational purposes, but you may do as you wish with it. Just don't steal it!

This project uses *SFML (Simple Fast Multimedia Library)*, *TinyXML*, and a slightly modified version of *Lua 5.1.4*.
