		<h2>What are Addons/Packages?</h2>
		<p>
			Addons, also known as Packages, are a package of Lua scripts, images, and other resources bundled up into a format that Pseudo Wire can use.<br/>
			For the sake of this reference, "package" will refer to the root addon folder and its contents and "addon" will refer to the addon as a whole.<br/>
			<br/>
			An example of a package is the Standard Lua Package, which can be found in the <code>addons</code> folder with Pseudo Wire, called <code>standard</code>.<br/>
			<br/>
			Addons usually consist of three folders: <code>lua</code>, <code>img</code>, <code>fnt</code> and an XML file, <code>info.xml</code>.<br/>
			<b>The <code>lua</code> folder</b> contains all of the Lua scripts the package is associated with.<br/>
			<b>The <code>img</code> folder</b> constains all of the image files that the package will use.<br/>
			<b>The <code>fnt</code> folder</b> constains all of the font files that the package will use.<br/>
			<br/>
			Not all packages will contain all folders, as some packages may associate their Lua scripts with other addon images.<br/>
			However, all addons must contain the <code>info.xml</code> file, which is read at the root directory of the package so Pseudo Wire knows what Lua scripts to include, their names, categories, and other properties.<br/>
			<br/>
			See the <a href="create.htm">Create Addon</a> page for more information on the <code>info.xml</code> file.
